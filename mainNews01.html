	<h1>Agreement signed with Korea to obtain 190 garbage compactors at zero interest</h1>

	<h3>Secretary to the Treasury, R.H.S. Samaratunga and Chief Representative of Korea Eximbank Colombo office Sungsoo Jung signing the loan agreements</h3>

	<p>The Government of Sri Lanka and the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) signed two loan agreements to supply 190 garbage compactors for Sri Lankan local governments to manage solid wastes in a more efficient way last week.  Secretary to the Treasury, Ministry of Finance and Mass Media R.H.S. Samaratunga and Chief Representative of Korea Eximbank Colombo office Sungsoo Jung signed the loan agreements at the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media.</p>


<p>The Korean Embassy in Colombo said that Korea Eximbank would finance this project with USD 14 million at 0% interest rate and 30 year repayment period including 10 year grace period. "The project executing agency will be the Ministry of Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports and the National Solid Waste Management Centre under the purview of the same Ministry will function as the project management unit.</p>


<p>"There is a serious shortage of waste collection equipment in Sri Lanka where only 11.6% of solid waste is collected by garbage compactors. In this context, by supplying 190 garbage compactors this project will not only reduce garbage collection time, but also increase solid waste collection quantity to improve the solid waste management in Sri Lanka.</p>


<p>Korea Eximbank is also financing USD 34 million to construct four sanitary landfills in Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Hikkaduwa to reduce solid wasts disposed in unsanitary open dumping sites. These four sanitary landfills will lessen further environmental pollution and damages and will enhance the health and sanitary lifestyle of people as well. "</p>


<p>The Export-Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) provides Official Development Assistance (ODA) loans through EDCF (Economic Development Cooperation Fund) for international development and cooperation. The bank provided its first ODA loan for the rehabilitation of the Colombo-Galle road (A2) in 1990. As of now, Korea Eximbank entrusted by the Korean government with the EDCF has approved USD 785.07 million for 29 development projects in Sri Lanka.</p>


<p>Korea Eximbank also provides financing for international trade and overseas investment, to promote bilateral economic cooperation. Since 1978, Korea Eximbank has provided US$ 386 million both for trade between Sri Lanka and Korea and for Korean companiesâ€™ foreign direct investments in Sri Lanka.</p>
